** Pitfalls
*** Do not cast an address that is not surely 32-bit aligned to a 32-bit pointer

#+begin_src c
//uint32_t addr = *((uint32_t*)(&my_struct.address));
// Do not cast an address that is not surely 32-bit aligned to a 32-bit pointer,
// because on ARM architecture the result is undefined.
//
// using memcpy() instead:
uint32_t addr;
memcpy(&addr,&my_struct.address,sizeof(uint32_t));
#+end_src

Also related: GCC has a warning that can help to identify points in the code
when we might be accessing unaligned data, which is activated with
~-Wcast-align~. It is not part of the warnings that are activated by options
~-Wall~ or ~-Wextra~, so we will have to add it explicitly if we want it. The
warning is only triggered when compiling for architectures that do not support
unaligned access for all types, so you will not see it if compiling only for
x86.

* Debian/Ubuntu

** Create a list of all installed packages

To create a list of the names of all installed packages on your Ubuntu or Debian system and save it in a file named packages_list.txt, run the following command:

#+begin_src shell
sudo dpkg-query -f '${binary:Package}\n' -W > packages_list.txt
#+end_src

Now that you have the list, if you want to install the same packages on your new server you can do that with:

#+begin_src shell
sudo xargs -a packages_list.txt apt install
#+end_src


* NixOS

** builds everything from source if Nix user isn't trusted
#+begin_quote
warning: ignoring untrusted substituter 'https://cachix.cachix.org'
#+end_quote

Workaround:
#+begin_src shell
echo "trusted-users = root $USER" | sudo tee -a /etc/nix/nix.conf"
sudo pkill nix-daemon
#+end_src

** nix.conf should be placed under ~/.config/nix/nix.conf
#+begin_src c
extra-experimental-features = flakes nix-command
#+end_src

* WSL

** Convenience

Run the following script after putting in your user name

#+begin_src shell
for i in Desktop Documents Downloads Videos Music Pictures; do
  ln -s /mnt/c/Users/<username>/$i ~
done
#+end_src

** How to Mount Windows Network Drives in WSL

*** Mount a Drive Until Logoff

1. Note the letter of the network drive that you would like to map in WSL. We will use M: in this example.
2. Create a new folder for that drive letter under /mnt if it does not already exist. (ex: ~mkdir /mnt/m~)
3. Mount the drive with ~sudo mount -t drvfs M: /mnt/m~


*** Mount Drives in a Persistent Manner

1. Ensure the folder exists for the mount target (e.g. /mnt/m)
2. Open /etc/fstab and add a line such as the following:
   M: /mnt/m drvfs defaults 0 0
3. Reload the fstab file with ~sudo mount -a~

** How to Shrink a WSL2 Virtual Disk

*** Before you begin

Before shrinking a WSL2 virtual disk, you need to ensure that WSL2 is not running.

You can check if it’s running with the command ~wsl.exe --list --verbose~ in PowerShell.
It should stop when it’s idle, or you can encourage it to stop with the ~wsl.exe --terminate~ command.

*** Use ~diskpart~ to Shrink a WSL2 Virtual Disk

You can launch the ~diskpart~ tool in ~PowerShell~.

You need to specify the path to your VHDX file.
#+begin_src powershell
select vdisk file="C:\Users\valorin\AppData\Local\Packages\WhitewaterFoundryLtd.Co.16571368D6CFF_kd...\LocalState\ext4.vhdx"
#+end_src

Once it’s selected, you can ask ~diskpart~ to compact it:
#+begin_src powershell
compact vdisk
#+end_src

Once that has finished, you can close ~diskpart~.

** WSL2 X11 programs "disappear"
[[https://github.com/nbdd0121/wsld][WSL Daemon - Stable X11 connection and time synchronisation for WSL2]]

** Launch file with a WSL App
[[https://github.com/mangelozzi/explorer_launch_wsl_app][Script]] to enable double click a file in explorer and launch/run it with a WSL App (Neovim, Vim, etc) within Windows Terminal

** Launching WSL Programs from a Right Click Windows Menu
